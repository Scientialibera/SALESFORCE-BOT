"""
Graph agent for relationship-based queries using Cosmos DB.

This agent specializes in querying the Cosmos DB graph database to find relationships,
patterns, and connections between entities in the Salesforce and SharePoint data.
The graph data is populated from the data lakehouse by the data engineering team.
It always resolves account names first before executing graph queries.
